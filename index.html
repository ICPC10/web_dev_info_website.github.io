        <h2>Front End</h2>
        <p>The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="column2">
        <h2>Back End</h2>
        <p>The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.</p>

      <div id="column3">
        <h2>Full Stack</h2>
        <p>The term full-stack means developers who are comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies.To be more specific, it means that the developer can work with databases, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between also.</p>
